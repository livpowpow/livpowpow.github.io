        <h1> LIV'S ASSESSMENT 1 PAGE ~ s3973120 </h1>
        <p> [A1 - INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE RESEARCH PROJECT]</p>
        <h2> PROJECT: Nathalie Lawhead - !!! TETRAGEDDON !!! </h2>

<h3> 1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </h3>
    <p> The very nature of the experience’s design makes it difficult to pinpoint what my eyes were first drawn to. I noticed the chaos and excessive pop-ups and alerts filling my screen </p>

<h3> 2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions</h3>

<ol> 
    <li> I attempted to close all the tabe on the first screen (It’s not possible D; )</li>
    <li> Clicked on various buttons on the pop ups and explored various tabs and text pop ups </li>
    <li> Clicked on the rubbish bin icon and explored the game graveyard </li>

    <p> Tabs/Mini Games Explored:</p>

    <li> Accept Cookies: tapped the cookies that popped up and bounced around the screen </li>
    <li> “CLICK HERE TO SCREAM” </li>
    <li> “DO IT CYBERMONKEY” [Then explored the resulting desktop screen] </li>
    <li> CYBERMONKEY INFESTATION = saved by computer angels </li>
    <li> Pop-up texts from buttons on (most notable: “the bugs do not want to be debugged” </li>

</ol>


<h3> 3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </h3>
    <p> After the cyber-monkey explosion montage, I spent time exploring the desktop there, searching for the proposed key and password to access other site elements. I also explored the page you are taken to if you click the trash on the initial screen. Within there, you can control a ghost with the arrow keys and explore various pages with references and graves dedicated to previous games made by the creator.</p>

<h3> 4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience? </h3>
    <p> Within the first 2 minutes, I think the most replicated action would be clicking buttons on pop-ups, whether one of the two options or attempting to click the X to close.</p>

<h3> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </h3>
    <p> The creator has intentionally made a game/site meant to frustrate and entertain those that interact with it. It is a satirical comment on the nature of advertisement, computer and scam pop-ups, giving off a chaotic artistic energy. A level of engagement with the site stems from trying to eliminate all the annoying pop-ups and moving elements. </p>

<h3> 6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal? </h3>
    <p> Frustration, entertainment and satire are all achieved in this experience through the aesthetic choices. By choosing to use familiar formatting with pop-ups, text, icons, etc., we know how we are ‘supposed to’ engage with it. This experience combats our initial idea of how to respond by changing the expected nature of these elements. Having elements popping up, disappearing, moving, spinning, etc. and having things take you to external tabs, makes it difficult to close or click Yes/No, and so on. </p>

<h3> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
    <p> In the three times that I have sat down and appropriately engaged with the site, I found something new each time; however, I’m not sure how much more there is to see. I think this experience offers the opportunity for it to be engaged with more than once (due to various layers and paths that can be taken via buttons), and depending on the person and whether you find a trail of links to follow, it can vary the time spent engaging with it. </p>

<h3> 8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time? </h3>
    <p> The experience uses/references “old-school” (I use that term lightly) computer visuals, and for the majority of people engaging with it now; they still understand the natural prompts and expected way to interact with the media. However, newer/younger generations may not engage with or get the same satisfaction from the experience as we do. </p>

<h3> 9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? </h3>
    <p> As very much said in previous questions, it heavily references the aesthetics/design choices of Windows/Microsofts’ earlier software/technology. This is seen in the font/text choices and the visual design of the popups and graphics.</p>

<h3> 10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience? </h3>
    <p> I touched on this in previous questions; however, knowing how to engage with the pop-ups and digital interactions on Windows prompts users to engage with the pop-ups on this site in the same way. Users want to click the X to close accept cookies, etc., but on this site, it isn’t that easy.</p>

<h3> 11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience? </h3>
    <p> Because we anticipate the buttons we click to do what they say they will, this experience provides a chaotic and frustrating feeling; however, it also includes humorous and curiosity-driving commentary. </p>

<h3> 12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating? </h3>
    <p> Aforementioned, the sheer nature of the moving and interactive elements on the website that tempt you to try and click on them is semi-frustrating. But despite the frustration it is still an entertaining concept.</p>

<h3> 13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying? </h3>
    <p> I enjoyed finding out what different buttons did and exploring allt the different side quest games and tabs within the one experience. It was satisfying to feel like I’ve found something secret and hidden within the site. </p>
