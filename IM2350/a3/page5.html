<!-- some of these sources are in the comments below -->

<!-- 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkDrG7G77Fg
- using subpages to create the desired navigation for my site

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiSvq5SgLMI
- creating links between all pages (home page to subpages & between subpages)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phWxA89Dy94&pp=ygUUcGFnZSBsYXlvdXQgaHRtbCBjc3M%3D
- refresher on how to create flex containers and layout my digital space
- i also referenced the first class exercise

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50243239/flexbox-image-on-the-right-side
- placing elements in specific areas of flex-boxes (used across various pages)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2204634/how-to-disable-automatic-links-coloring-without-selecting-a-color
- to remove the colour change that was applied to the linked text
- i wanted the links between pages to be more subtle (but still visible and accessible) 
but not overly contrasted (like they would be if they changed colour from the majority text colour)

<!-- future direction?
This site could be used a archive for poetry, a place to share and display written art in various ways; 
the used examples of poetry may not necessarily appear if the project where to be a platform for users to act and engage with. 
In a circumstance where the site gains traffic, it could be a place to help provide exposure for poets posting their written work online; and all their work is creatively referenced accordingly in that case.
